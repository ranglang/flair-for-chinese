# Tutorial 1: NLP Base Types

This is part 1 of the tutorial, in which we look into some of the base types used in this library.

## Creating a Sentence

There are two types of objects that are central to this library, namely the `Sentence` and `Token` objects. A
`Sentence` holds a textual sentence and is essentially a list of `Token`.

Let's start by making a `Sentence` object for an example sentence.

```python
# The sentence objects holds a sentence that we may want to embed or tag
from flair.data import Sentence

# Make a sentence object by passing a whitespace tokenized string
sentence = Sentence('The grass is green .')

# Print the object to see what's in there
print(sentence)
```

This should print:

```console
Sentence: "The grass is green ." - 5 Tokens
```

The print-out tells us that the sentence consists of 5 tokens.
You can access the tokens of a sentence via their token id or with their index:

```python
# using the token id
print(sentence.get_token(4))
# using the index itself
print(sentence[3]
```

which should print in both cases

```console
Token: 4 green
```

This print-out includes the token id (4) and the lexical value of the token ("green"). You can also iterate over all
tokens in a sentence.

```python
for token in sentence:
    print(token)
```

This should print:

```console
Token: 1 The
Token: 2 grass
Token: 3 is
Token: 4 green
Token: 5 .
```

## Tokenization

In some use cases, you might not have your text already tokenized. For this case, we added a simple tokenizer using the
lightweight [segtok library](https://pypi.org/project/segtok/).

Simply use the `use_tokenizer` flag when instantiating your `Sentence` with an untokenized string:

```python
from flair.data import Sentence

# Make a sentence object by passing an untokenized string and the 'use_tokenizer' flag
sentence = Sentence('The grass is green.', use_tokenizer=True)

# Print the object to see what's in there
print(sentence)
```

This should print:

```console
Sentence: "The grass is green ." - 5 Tokens
```

## Adding Tags to Tokens

A `Token` has fields for linguistic annotation, such as lemmas, part-of-speech tags or named entity tags. You can
add a tag by specifying the tag type and the tag value. In this example, we're adding an NER tag of type 'color' to
the word 'green'. This means that we've tagged this word as an entity of type color.

```python
# add a tag to a word in the sentence
sentence[3].add_tag('ner', 'color')

# print the sentence with all tags of this type
print(sentence.to_tagged_string())
```

This should print:

```console
The grass is green <color> .
```

## Adding Labels to Sentences

A `Sentence` can have one or multiple labels that can for example be used in text classification tasks.
For instance, the example below shows how we add the label 'sports' to a sentence, thereby labeling it
as belonging to the sports category.

```python
sentence = Sentence('France is the current world cup winner.')

# add a label to a sentence
sentence.add_label(Label('sports'))

# a sentence can also belong to multiple classes
sentence.add_labels([Label('sports'), Label('world cup')])

# you can also set the labels while initializing the sentence
Sentence('France is the current world cup winner.', labels=[Label('sports'), Label('world cup')])
```


## Reading CoNLL-formatted Files

We provide a set of helper methods to read CoNLL parsed files as a list of `Sentence` objects. For instance, you can
use the popular CoNLL-U format introduced by the Universal Dependencies project.

Simply point the `NLPTaskDataFetcher` to the file containing the parsed sentences. It will read the sentences into a
list of `Sentence`.

```python
from flair.data_fetcher import NLPTaskDataFetcher

# use your own data path
data_folder = 'path/to/conll/formatted/data'

# get training, test and dev data
sentences: List[Sentence] = NLPTaskDataFetcher.read_conll_ud(data_folder)
```

Importantly, these sentences now contain a wealth of `Token` level annotations.
In the case of CoNLL-U, they should contain information including a token lemma, its part-of-speech, morphological
annotation, its dependency relation and its head token.
You can access this information using the tag fields of the `Token`.

## Reading Files for Text Classification Tasks

We also provide a helper method to read files that contain data for text classification tasks. Such files should have the following format:
```text
__label__<label_1> <text>
__label__<label_1> __label__<label_2> <text>
```
Each line contains a textual document. A document can have one or multiple labels that are defined at the beginning of the line starting with the prefix
`__label__`.

To read such data, simply use the `NLPTaskDataFetcher` which converts each line to a `Sentence` object and assigns the labels. It returns a list of `Sentence`.

```python
from flair.data_fetcher import NLPTaskDataFetcher

# use your own data path
data_folder = 'path/to/text-classification/formatted/data'

# get training, test and dev data
sentences: List[Sentence] = NLPTaskDataFetcher.read_text_classification_file(data_folder)
```

If your text classification data files have a different format, feel free to add new methods to the `NLPTaskDataFetcher`.
